### Weights and Load Problem using Hill Climbing Algorithm 
#### Problem Description:
There are two lorries (A and B) used to transport bricks from one point to another. You have a groups of bricks, of which each have different weights. Assuming there is no maximum load for the lorries, but both lorries should be loaded with a number of bricks that weights are divided equally (or as equal as possible). You are tasked to employ a heuristic search method i.e., Hill Climbing (Random Mutation) to solve the problem.
